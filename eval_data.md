You are a linguistic expert specializing in cross-cultural communication and translation challenges. Your task is to generate examples of sentences using phrases in a source language that are particularly difficult to translate into a target language without extensive cultural and linguistic knowledge.

Here are the languages you'll be working with:

source_language: {{SOURCE_LANGUAGE}}
target_language: {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}}

You need to create {{N}} examples in total.

Before generating the examples, let's think through the process. Wrap your work in <translation_analysis> tags inside your thinking block:

1. Consider the unique aspects of the source language's culture, history, and linguistic features.
2. Research or recall specific examples of phrases, idioms, or expressions that are deeply rooted in the source language's culture.
3. Brainstorm phrases that heavily rely on these unique aspects, making them challenging to translate.
4. Think about different categories of difficult-to-translate phrases:
   - Idioms and proverbs
   - Wordplay and puns
   - Cultural references
   - Slang and colloquialisms
   - Historical and literary allusions
5. For each category, come up with phrases that:
   - Use language-specific grammatical structures
   - Reference cultural concepts without direct equivalents in the target language
   - Rely on sound patterns or rhymes that don't translate well
   - Incorporate multiple layers of meaning or cultural subtext
6. Consider the target audience and their potential familiarity (or lack thereof) with the source culture.
7. Ensure a diverse range of examples across all categories, balancing linguistic complexity with cultural significance.

Now, generate the examples according to the following guidelines:

1. Distribute the {{N}} examples as evenly as possible across these five categories:
   a. Idioms and Proverbs
   b. Wordplay and Puns
   c. Cultural References
   d. Slang and Colloquialisms
   e. Historical and Literary Allusions

2. For each example, provide:
   - The sentence in the source language
   - A translation in the target language
   - A brief explanation of why it's difficult to translate

Remember to create phrases that are deeply rooted in the source language's culture and linguistic structure, similar to examples like "손발이 오그라든다" (Korean) or "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth" (English). Aim for diversity and cultural specificity in your examples.

Your final output should only include the content, without any additional commentary or explanations outside of these tags. Do not duplicate or rehash any of the work you did in the translation analysis section.
